## ⚙️ Setting Up Jenkins on AWS EC2 (t3.medium)

Jenkins was installed on an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu t3.medium instance**, which provides a balanced mix of CPU and memory suitable for running CI/CD workloads.  
The setup followed the step-by-step guide from the [Jenkins Setup Site](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/), including the installation of required dependencies such as **Java**, **Git**, and the **Jenkins service** configuration.

After installation, Jenkins was accessed through the default port **8080**, where the **initial setup page** appeared, prompting for the administrator password and plugin configuration.

This server now serves as the **core automation engine** of the CI/CD pipeline, connecting seamlessly with **GitHub (via webhooks)**, **SonarQube**, **Nexus**, and **Tomcat** for continuous integration and deployment.

## 🧩 Setting Up SonarQube for Code Quality Analysis

SonarQube was installed on a dedicated **AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance (t3.medium)** and integrated with Jenkins to perform **automated code quality checks** after every build.  
The installation followed the guide in the [SonarQube Official Site for Setup](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/server-installation/introduction), which includes steps for setting up **PostgreSQL**, configuring **SonarQube as a system service**, and opening the default **port 9000** for access.

Once the server was up and running, the **initial SonarQube dashboard** appeared, allowing configuration of projects, tokens, and **Quality Gates** to enforce clean code standards.

📸 **Screenshot:**

A custom **Quality Gate** was defined to ensure that:
- Code coverage remains above a set threshold  
- No new critical issues or bugs are introduced  
- Maintainability, reliability, and security ratings remain within acceptable limits

### 🔐 Integrating SonarQube with Jenkins

To enable Jenkins to communicate securely with SonarQube, the **SonarQube Scanner** plugin was installed and configured in Jenkins.  
This setup allows Jenkins to trigger code analysis automatically during the pipeline execution.

Steps:
1. Navigate to **Manage Jenkins → System → SonarQube Servers**
2. Add a new server name (e.g., `sonarserver`)
3. Provide the **Server URL** (e.g., `http://<your-sonarqube-server>:9000`)
4. Add and select the **Authentication Token** generated from SonarQube under Jenkins credentials

📸 **Screenshot:**  
![SonarQube Credentials Configuration in Jenkins](Screenshots/jenkins-sonarqube.png)

Once configured, the Jenkins pipeline can reference the server using:
stage("code analysis"){
            environment {
                ScannerHome = tool "codescan"
            }
            steps {
                script{
                    withSonarQubeEnv("sonarserver"){
                        sh "${scannerHome}/bin/sonar-scanner -Dsonar.projectKey=projectname"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

### 🧱 Custom Quality Gate Configuration

SonarQube was configured with a **custom Quality Gate** focused on essential metrics that define clean, maintainable, and secure code.  
The gate helps ensure that every build meets baseline standards before deployment.

**Quality Gate Metrics:**
| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Issues** | Overall code issues detected (bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities) |
| **Security Hotspots Reviewed** | Number of security hotspots manually reviewed | 100% reviewed |
| **Duplicated Lines (%)** | Percentage of duplicated code | Less than **3%** |
| **Coverage** | Test coverage of new and changed code | Greater than **80%** |

📸 **Screenshot:**
![[SonarQube Quality Gate Dashboard](Screenshots/sonarqube_metrics.png)

This gate was assigned to the main project, ensuring that any build failing to meet these conditions will **not pass** the Jenkins CI pipeline.  
This setup promotes better **code security**, **maintainability**, and **team accountability** in the development lifecycle.

This setup ensures that Jenkins pipelines automatically trigger SonarQube analysis for every commit, providing developers with immediate feedback on code quality and technical debt.


## 🏗️ Nexus Repository Setup

**Nexus Repository Manager** was used as the artifact repository to store and version the `.war` files generated from Jenkins builds.  
This ensures consistent artifact management, traceability, and smooth deployment to the Tomcat server.

## 🏗️ Nexus Repository Setup

**Nexus Repository Manager** was used as the artifact repository to store and version the `.war` files generated from Jenkins builds.  
This ensures consistent artifact management, traceability, and smooth deployment to the Tomcat server.

### ⚙️ Configuration Overview

1. **Installation:**  
   Nexus was installed on an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu t3.medium instance** using the official [Sonatype Nexus 3.x distribution](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/installation).  
   After installation, the service was configured to start automatically and exposed on port `8081`.

2. **Repository Setup:**  
   A new hosted **Maven (release)** repository was created and named: albertcloudz

This repository serves as the destination for the `.war` artifacts uploaded from Jenkins after successful builds.

3. **Jenkins Integration:**  
In Jenkins, the **Nexus Artifact Uploader Plugin** was configured with:
- **Repository URL:** `http://<nexus-server-ip>:8081/repository/albertcloudz/`  
- **Credentials:** A Nexus username and token securely stored in Jenkins credentials  
- **GroupId / ArtifactId / Version:** Automatically mapped from the project’s `pom.xml`  

Once the build is complete, Jenkins uploads the packaged `.war` file to Nexus.

### 📦 Artifact Storage Example

Below is an example of the deployed artifact visible in the Nexus dashboard:

📸 **Screenshot:**  
![Nexus Repository Artifact](Screenshots/nexus-artifact-deployed.png)

| Attribute | Example |
|------------|----------|
| **Group ID** | `com.mt` |
| **Artifact ID** | `maven-web-application` |
| **Version** | `3.0.6-RELEASE` |
| **File Type** | `.war` |
| **Repository** | `albertcloudz` |

This setup enables reliable artifact storage, supports rollback in case of failed deployments, and improves overall CI/CD workflow efficiency.

## 🚀 Apache Tomcat Deployment

**Apache Tomcat** serves as the final stage of this CI/CD pipeline — the environment where the packaged `.war` file is deployed and made accessible to users.  
After Jenkins builds the code, runs SonarQube analysis, and uploads the artifact to Nexus, it automatically deploys the web application to **Tomcat 9** hosted on an **AWS EC2 t3.medium (Ubuntu)** instance.

---

### ⚙️ Configuration Overview

1. **Installation:**  
   Tomcat 9 was installed on an Ubuntu-based EC2 instance.  
   For full installation instructions, follow the [official Apache Tomcat documentation](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/setup.html).

2. **User Configuration:**  
   A deployment user was created in the `tomcat-users.xml` file with the `manager-script` role to enable Jenkins to deploy automatically via the **Deploy to Container** plugin.

   <role rolename="manager-script"/>
   <user username="deployer" password="your_password" roles="manager-script"/>
### 🧩 Jenkins Integration

In Jenkins, the **Deploy to Container Plugin** was configured as follows:

| Configuration Item | Value |
|--------------------|--------|
| **Container Type** | Tomcat 9.x |
| **Manager URL** | `http://<ec2-public-ip>:8080/manager/text` |
| **Credentials** | `deployer` *(stored securely under Jenkins credentials)* |
| **WAR File Path** | `target/web-app.war` |


---

### 🔒 Security Group Configuration

Port **8080** was opened in the EC2 instance’s **security group** to allow external access to both the Tomcat Manager interface and the deployed web application.

---

### 🌐 Deployment Verification

Once Jenkins completes the pipeline successfully, the application is deployed automatically to **Apache Tomcat**.  
You can verify the deployment through the **Tomcat Web Application Manager**, which displays the deployed web applications, their paths, and running statuses.
